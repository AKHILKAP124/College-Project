        An online voting system that will replace the old ballot sytem or paper
        system. Over the time we have utilized the required technology in every
        sector to improve efficiency and save the extra resources. But the
        voting system is still very expensive and requires a bigger workforce.
        The system is slower and still not completely tamper proof. We bring the
        system that is safe, reliable and solve the modern issues like higher
        reachability of the booth, crowd free voting, inexpensive, faster
        results and others.
